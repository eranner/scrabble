# scrabble
A digital version of the popular board game! This was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. A timer has been added as well, which makes use of setInterval, which was focused on heavily in the first part of the MIT bootcamp.

##How To Run: 

This is fairly simple to use. The logo is set up to be a background, but once you scroll down you get to the actual gameboard.

To use the gameboard, scroll to the center of the board, where you see the black star. To use a letter, tap the 'letters' button. This will reveal all of the letters.

Drag the letters from the letter box and drop them into desired position. Hovering over a letter will make it invisible to allow you to see if there is a bonuse tile underneath your letter.

If a mistake is made, hover over the incorrect letter and left click. This will remove the letter fromt he gameboard.

**Letters cannot be placed to the left or the right of the letter box, you must scroll up and place the letters somewhere underneath**

To use the timer, simply hit the start button. This will count down the sixty seconds until it gets to zero. If not all time is needed, hit STOP.

**Make sure you STOP and RESET the timer. If you fail to do so, the timer will get thrown out of whack. You don't have to stop the timer if all time has been used**

##Roadmap of Improvements:

A few things can certainly be improved. The biggest issue is the fact that if you refresh the browser, you lose the game. That would be the most important thing to fix.

Another issue is the timer. It should be free of bugs and should not need to be stopped to reset correctly.

The positioning of the letter container could be changed to allow you to put letters to the left or right of it.
